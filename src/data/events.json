        "description": "Speaker:\nDr Kimberly Davis\nProgrammatic assessment implies that assessment is organised across a programme, rather than for individual courses. This programme structure allows for iterative assessment practices to flourish, and for students to engage with the assessment process more meaningfully. This session will help participants think about how to map their courses programmatically and make meaningful links between courses on a programme.\nregister now",

Of course, this is an activity that occurs throughout the whole process, from reflection all the way through to implementation. In this session we look at how to identify ways in which to build in writing into your regular practices, whether those be daily, weekly, or less often. As well as looking at strategies for developing regular writing practices, we will also consider which tools you might use to help you to take and make notes.\nregister now",

Examples of successful SoTL publications will be provided in order to help us to plan for our own publications.\nregister now",

In this session we each take time to look back at our previous learning, teaching and SoTL activities and celebrate any successes we have had, however large or small these might be. We also reflect on any challenges we have faced and consider how we might overcome any such barriers in the future. Then we look forward and consider how we would like to engage in SoTL over the summer months – and even begin planning for the next academic year.\nregister now",
